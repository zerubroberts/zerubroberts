## About Me

I'm a **Senior Data Scientist and ML Engineer** based in Melbourne, Australia, with over **8 years of experience** building production-grade machine learning systems and enterprise analytics platforms. My work sits at the intersection of advanced analytics, cloud architecture, and business strategy—turning complex data challenges into measurable competitive advantages.

I've led data transformation initiatives across **utilities, fintech, healthcare, and construction**, delivering solutions that have generated **$2M+ in documented cost savings** and automated processes that previously consumed thousands of manual hours. My approach combines deep technical expertise with a strong focus on business outcomes—every model I build, every dashboard I deploy, is designed to drive real decisions.

Currently, I serve as **Data Consultant Lead at Cast Solutions**, where I architect end-to-end analytics solutions for enterprise clients, and as a **Data Analytics Instructor at Pathstream**, where I've trained **500+ professionals** from Amazon and Walmart in modern data practices.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### Intelligent Email Triage System
**FinTech · Production · Enterprise Scale**

<img align="right" width="100" src="https://img.icons8.com/fluency/100/artificial-intelligence.png"/>

One of my most impactful projects—an intelligent email classification system that revolutionized customer service operations for a global fintech company. The challenge was significant: manual email processing was consuming 40% of operational costs, and the volume was scaling faster than the team could hire.

I designed and built an end-to-end NLP solution using AWS SageMaker that automatically classifies incoming emails, routes them to appropriate teams, and generates automated responses for common queries. The system processes thousands of emails daily with real-time inference.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Custom text classification models trained on historical email data
- Real-time inference pipeline with sub-second response times
- Automated response generation for routine inquiries
- Full MLOps implementation with MLFlow tracking and model versioning
- Continuous monitoring with automatic retraining triggers

**Results:**
| Metric | Impact |
|:-------|:-------|
| Email Deflection | 40% of emails handled automatically |
| Cost Savings | $2M+ annually |
| Processing Time | Reduced from hours to seconds |
| Accuracy | 70%+ classification accuracy |

### Predictive Power Failure System
**Utilities · Live Production · Multi-Region Deployment**

<img align="right" width="100" src="https://img.icons8.com/fluency/100/lightning-bolt.png"/>

Working with a major Australian utility provider, I built a predictive maintenance system that forecasts power failures before they happen. The system integrates real-time weather data with historical failure patterns to enable proactive maintenance scheduling.

This was a fascinating challenge in ensemble modeling—combining multiple forecasting approaches to achieve reliable predictions across diverse weather conditions and infrastructure types. The system is now deployed across Eastern Victoria and has fundamentally changed how the utility approaches maintenance.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Ensemble models combining gradient boosting, random forests, and neural networks
- Real-time integration with Bureau of Meteorology weather APIs
- Geospatial analysis for infrastructure vulnerability mapping
- Custom alerting system with severity-based prioritization
- Dashboard for operations teams with drill-down capabilities

**Results:**
| Metric | Impact |
|:-------|:-------|
| Deployment | Live across Eastern Victoria |
| Maintenance | Shifted from reactive to proactive |
| Outage Duration | Significant reduction in average outage time |
| Cost Efficiency | Prevention-based cost savings |

### PPE Compliance Detection System
**Construction · Active Deployment · Real-time Monitoring**

<img align="right" width="100" src="https://img.icons8.com/fluency/100/safety-hat.png"/>

Safety compliance on construction sites is critical but traditionally relies on manual monitoring—which is inconsistent and resource-intensive. I developed a computer vision system that automatically detects PPE compliance in real-time, instantly alerting supervisors when violations occur.

The system uses cameras positioned at key entry and work zones to continuously monitor worker safety equipment. When non-compliance is detected, it triggers immediate SMS alerts to site supervisors with location and violation details.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Custom object detection models trained on construction site imagery
- Integration with AWS Rekognition for robust detection
- Real-time video stream processing with OpenCV
- SMS alert system via Twilio for instant notifications
- Admin dashboard for compliance reporting and analytics

**Results:**
| Metric | Impact |
|:-------|:-------|
| Monitoring | 24/7 automated coverage |
| Response Time | Instant violation alerts |
| Compliance Rate | Measurable improvement in PPE adherence |
| Incidents | Reduction in safety incidents |

### Multi-Channel Volume Forecasting
**Customer Service · Production · Global Deployment**

<img align="right" width="100" src="https://img.icons8.com/fluency/100/graph-report.png"/>

Resource planning in customer service is a constant balancing act—too few agents means long wait times, too many means wasted costs. I built a sophisticated demand forecasting system that predicts customer contact volumes across multiple channels (phone, email, chat) with country-specific models.

The system integrates directly with roster management software, enabling operations teams to optimize staffing levels weeks in advance. It accounts for seasonality, marketing campaigns, product launches, and even external factors like holidays and events.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Time series models (Prophet, ARIMA, LSTM) with ensemble averaging
- Feature engineering incorporating external signals
- Country-specific model variants for regional patterns
- Direct integration with workforce management systems
- Automated daily forecast updates with confidence intervals

**Results:**
| Metric | Impact |
|:-------|:-------|
| Accuracy | 74% MAPE across all channels |
| Planning Horizon | 4-week ahead forecasting |
| Integration | Direct roster management connection |
| Efficiency | Optimized staffing costs |
